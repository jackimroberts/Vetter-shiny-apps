# Vetter Lab data

In this directory are R shiny apps to explore published data from the Vetter Lab.

Note that this does not include the data files but running the app will pull them from GEO.

## Microglia during retinal development

##### Whole retina timecourse, bulk RNA-seq

Triplicate central retina samples at e16.5, and single whole retina samples at P7 and P60. Published in Anderson et al. Cell Reports, 2019. GSE123757

##### Retinal microglia timecourse, bulk RNA-seq
Three biological replicates of retinal microglia (GFP+, CD45+, CCR2âˆ’) at e16.5, P7 and P60. 
Published in [Anderson et al. Cell Reports, 2019](%2210.1016/j.celrep.2019.04.062). GSE123757

##### Brain microglia timecourse, bulk RNA-seq
Duplicate e16, P7 brain (CD45+CD11B+CX3CR1-GFP+) and P60 cortex microglia (CD45-int CD11B-int CX3CR1-GFP+)
Fastq files from Matcovich Natan et al., Science, 2016 GSE79812. Also analyzed in Anderson et al. Cell Reports, 2019.

##### Itgax+ microglia, bulk RNA-seq
P5 CD11c-Cre-gfp;Rosa-TDTomato sorted for active Cd11c expression (GFP+TdTom+) or Cd11c lineage (GFP-TdTom+). 
This is unplished and won't show up.
